Utilizing sophisticated regression methods like Ridge and Lasso to forecast home prices.

Surprise Housing, a US-based real estate company, has made the decision to join the Australian market. The company buys houses below market value and resells them for a greater price by using data analytics. The company has gathered a data set from Australian home sales for the same reason. The 'test.csv' file that was uploaded to the repository contains the data.

The business is considering potential properties to purchase in order to enter the market. To determine whether to invest in the potential properties and to anticipate their actual value, this repository employs regularisation to develop a regression model.

What factors are important in estimating a home's price, according to the company? -How well do such factors capture the cost of a home?

The model employs ridge and lasso regression to arrive at a final optimal lambda that represents housing prices, using GridSearchCV.
